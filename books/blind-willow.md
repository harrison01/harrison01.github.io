Long since I read Kafka on the Shore, this time, [Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman](http://library.cmi.ac.in/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=8212). Short stories. 

One of the great experiences of reading Murakami is you not only visualize what the characters do, but also what the characters think. *"I'll never go to use those again"*. Is this what was the twenty-year old boy thinking, when he was taking his icecream before cutting his slit and drowning in the pool? [Elis Shuman](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/ellis-shuman/haruki-murakami_b_6544212.html) nicely said, "Murakami takes the reader on a extended visit on characters mind." Sometimes reminds me of Saratchandra, where Ram hit his head with hard grapefruits to test how much it caused pain to his sister.

And Murakami is `U-N-P-R-E-D-I-C-T-A-B-L-E`. How come a story start with some girl working in a restaurant, being gloomy because she has to work on her twientieth birthday ends with "What would you've wished if you're asked to make one and only one wish? You can't? *That's because you've already made your wish.*"?

Beautiful small details. 
That's why Norwegian Wood, the movie probably disappointed me so much. How can you catch this beauty in a film? That's where art forms probably differs.

*Book Thief* had a nice 

Don't know why, but Murakami looks at death in a strange way. *“Death is not the opposite of life, but a part of it.”* How come?

And finally, everyone is a superhero. Probably, Murakami also believes this. So, his characters are not superpowered. Common people like us, who thinks, dreams, gets depressed, again dreams, cries, laughs, *talks to themseles*, fears death, wishes a love, fails in love. And some are strangest, *goes to visit a zoo when a typhoon comes*. 

The stories are so much like dreams. They don't carry a meaning, but you love to think about it after you wake up, and you cherish.

But, shouldn't life should carry a meaning? Or, not necessarily?

The stories are weird, absard, meaningless. Again colorful with vivid descriptions. Maybe because we're too familiar with less stories more thrillers and suspences, which will find a destinated win of a hero. But life is not like that, right? The day to day life is colorless, boring, yet gets a meaning when looked at closely, described well. Isn't it the way fairytales should be written?
