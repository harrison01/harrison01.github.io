Sunday, September 10, 2017, 3'o clock in the afternoon. Why so much facebook, let's start reading. 

* The first book I started to read is Murakami's [Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman](/books/blind-willow/).
* Will God Delusion be the next? Sohail suggested.
* One fine evening, thought about reading world history and geography. Library had a book, Jawaharlal Nehru's Glimpses of World History. Nehru writes great chapters human civilizations in a letter to her 13-year old daughter, Priyadarshini. Teachers may think in this way, if (s)he were to teach his own child/sibling, would have he taught in the same way he is teaching in this class now?
