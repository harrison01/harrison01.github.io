* Combinatorics
	- *Catalan numbers.* Tom Davis described different occurances of Catalan Number here. Available at Barkeley Math Circle site, from [here](http://mathcircle.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/BMC6/pdf0607/catalan.pdf).

* Probability
    - Stuck? Feeling bored why study all these inequalities, bounds?

They eventually wants to conclude to Randomized algos, so, it is a motivating read.
